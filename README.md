## What's New in 4.8.0

A security-refresh release — see [Changelog.md](Changelog.md) for the full detail.

- **5 high-severity `npm audit` vulnerabilities → 0**, including the Dependabot-flagged **PostCSS path traversal** ([GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849)) — `postcss` is now 8.5.25.
- **`react-router-dom` → `react-router` 8.3.0.** The React Router RSC CSRF advisory affects the entire `7.12.0 – 8.2.0` range, and `react-router-dom` is discontinued at 7.18.2 pinned to a vulnerable 7.x. Since v7's `react-router-dom` was already a re-export shim, this is a pure import swap with no behaviour change.
  - ⚠️ **Update your custom pages**: change `from 'react-router-dom'` to `from 'react-router'`.
- **Major bumps, all verified**: `react-dropzone` 15 → 20, `apexcharts` 5 → 6, `@testing-library/jest-dom` 6 → 7, `jsdom` 29 → 30.
- **React 19.2.8**, Vite 8.2, Vitest 4.1.10, Sass 1.102 and the rest of the stack on latest.
- **Now requires Node.js 22+** (`react-dropzone` 20, `jest-dom` 7).
- **Verified green**: 0 lint errors, 23/23 unit tests, clean production build.
- **ESLint held at 9.x** — its `react` / `jsx-a11y` plugins still don't support ESLint 10.

## Previous Release: 4.7.0

- **6 `npm audit` vulnerabilities → 0**; `react-router` 7.18.0 and `vite` 8.1.0 patched two high-severity advisories.
- **`Rating` component** rewritten to React's adjust-state-during-render pattern.

## Environment Variables

Copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env.local` and adjust as needed. Only `VITE_`-prefixed keys are exposed to the browser bundle.

| Key         | Default | Effect                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_PORT` | `3001`  | Dev server port                                                                                                |
| `VITE_BASE` | `./`    | Public base path used by the production build (set to e.g. `"/architectui/"` when deploying to a subdirectory) |

## Testing

Two layers of tests:

**Unit / component (Vitest + React Testing Library)** — tests live next to the code as `*.test.jsx`:

```bash
npm test              # watch mode
npm test -- --run     # single run
npm run test:coverage # v8 coverage report under coverage/
```

Shared setup (matchers, RTL cleanup, `matchMedia` / `ResizeObserver` / `localStorage` shims) is in [vitest.setup.js](vitest.setup.js); config is in [vitest.config.js](vitest.config.js).

**End-to-end (Playwright)** — [e2e/routes.spec.js](e2e/routes.spec.js) spins up `npm run preview` and walks 24 demo routes, failing on any uncaught page error or "Element type is invalid" / "not a constructor" console error. First run needs the browser installed:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:install    # once
npm run test:e2e            # run the suite
```

Config in [playwright.config.js](playwright.config.js).

## Reliability Features

- **Top-level `<ErrorBoundary>`** ([src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx](src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx)) catches any render-time crash in the demo pages and shows a friendly card with the error message, component stack (dev only), and a reload button instead of blanking the screen.
- **Theme preferences persist to `localStorage`** ([src/config/persistThemeOptions.js](src/config/persistThemeOptions.js)). Color scheme, fixed-header / fixed-sidebar / fixed-footer toggles, background image, dark-mode choice, and the page-title options all survive refresh. A whitelist controls what gets written so non-persisted UI state stays in memory.
- **Dark mode** via Bootstrap 5.3's `data-bs-theme`. Auto (follows `prefers-color-scheme`), Light, or Dark — picked from the ThemeOptions side panel and persisted. [`src/hooks/useDarkModeSync.js`](src/hooks/useDarkModeSync.js) keeps `<html>` in sync and re-reacts to OS changes when the user leaves the pref on Auto.
- **Accessibility basics** — skip-to-content link, `<header>` / `<nav>` / `<main>` landmarks, `:focus-visible` rings, `aria-label` / `aria-expanded` / `aria-pressed` on icon-only buttons, keyboard activation on the mobile overlay scrim.

## Starting a new project

See [STARTER.md](STARTER.md) for the full "strip to starter" guide. Short version: `rm -rf src/DemoPages/`, swap three files, and you're left with just the shell + reliability features.

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions runs on every push and pull request using the Node version pinned in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc). Pipeline:

1. `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps`
2. `npm run lint`
3. `npx vitest run`
4. `npm run build`
5. `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`
6. `npx playwright test --project=chromium` (Playwright report uploaded as an artifact if any step fails)

See [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Browser Support

ArchitectUI React supports all modern browsers:

- **Chrome** (latest)
- **Firefox** (latest)
- **Safari** (latest)
- **Edge** (latest)
- **Opera** (latest)

## Customization

### Theme Colors

Customize the color scheme by modifying the Sass variables in:

- `src/assets/themes/[theme-name]/_variables.scss`

### Layout Configuration

- `src/reducers/ThemeOptions.jsx`

### Adding New Components
